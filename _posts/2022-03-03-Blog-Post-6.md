# Blog Post 6: Fake News Classifier

In this last blog post, we are going to build our own models that identifies whether a piece of news is fake. We will try to build three different models using *Functional API* and compare their results.

As usual, we start by importing the necessary packages:


```python
import pandas as pd
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import tensorflow as tf
import re
import string
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
from tensorflow.keras import layers 
from tensorflow.keras import losses 
from tensorflow import keras
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio 
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"
from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import TextVectorization 
from tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing import StringLookup
```

    [nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...
    [nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.


## §1. Acquire Training Data

The training data comes from Kaggle. We extract it from url.


```python
train_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_train.csv?raw=true"
```


```python
traindata = pd.read_csv(train_url)
traindata.head()
```

We can see that the data includes three useful columns: title, text, and the target variable fake (1 means it is a fake news, 0 otherwise).

## §2. Make a Dataset

We want to write a function that helps us make a tensorflow dataset. In particular, the function should be able to
1. remove all stopwords
2. return a tensorflow dataset with two inputs and one output. The input should be of the form (title, text) , and the output should consist only of the fake column. 
We also want to batch the data to increase training accuracy later.


```python
def make_dataset(df):
  """
  This function helps to remove stopwords in data and returns a tf dataset.
  """
  stop = stopwords.words('english')
  #remove stopwords from titles and texts
  df['title'] = df['title'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
  df['text'] = df['text'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop)]))
  
  #create the tf dataset as required
  data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
      (
          {
              "title" : df[["title"]],
              "text" : df[["text"]]
          },{
              "fake" : df[["fake"]]
          }
      )
  )

  #return a batched dataset
  return data.batch(100)
```


```python
#make our data
data = make_dataset(traindata)
```

Now that we have the tf dataset (this is only our training data), we take out **20% as validation data**. Testing data will be provided later.


```python
data = data.shuffle(buffer_size = len(data))
#20% as validation
val_size   = int(0.2*len(data))
val    = data.take(val_size)
train  = data.skip(val_size)
```

We would also want to examine the **base rate**, the accuracy of a model that always makes the same guess (for example, such a model might always say “fake news!”). Note that for around **52.3%** of time this guess will be correct. Our models must achieve a significantly higher accuracy in order to be helpful.


```python
traindata.groupby("fake").size()
```




    fake
    0    10709
    1    11740
    dtype: int64




```python
#calculate the base rate
11740/(11740+10709)
```




    0.522963160942581



## §3. Create Models

Before building our model, we would like to set a goal for today's blog post. We want to examine the following question:

*When detecting fake news, is it most effective to focus on only the title of the article, the full text of the article, or both?*

The first model we build will use only the title variable, the second will use only text, and the third both.


```python
#set up the inputs
#note tha both inputs have the same type and shape

title_input = keras.Input(
    shape = (1,),
    name = "title",
    dtype = "string"
)
text_input = keras.Input(
    shape = (1,),
    name = "text",
    dtype = "string"
)
```

Specifically, we create the embedding layer outside of all models so that we can reuse this layer for each model we build. I specified the vocab size to be a bit larger than the example in lecture because I want to make it easier to interpret the embedding result later on.


```python
size_vocabulary = 3000
vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(output_mode='int',max_tokens=3000)
vectorize_layer.adapt(train.map(lambda x, y: x["title"]))
vectorize_layer.adapt(train.map(lambda x, y: x["text"]))
#embedding layer
embedding = layers.Embedding(size_vocabulary, 3, name = "embedding") 
```

## First Model

For the first model, we will only be using the article **title**. I have tried several different parameters for the Dropout layer. A dropout rate of 10% is ideal from my observation, because higher dropout resulted in a perceivably higher accuracy for the validation set than the training set, which is somewhat unnecessary. Also the overall accuracy is negatively affected. When I used 10% dropout rate, the validation and training accuracy were similar, and they both reached a very high overall accuracy.

I also tried ou 20/30/40 epochs. Over several trials, the model performance became stable for more than 30 epochs.


```python
title_features = vectorize_layer(title_input)
title_features = embedding(title_features) 
#include two drop out layers to prevent overfitting
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.1)(title_features)
title_features = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dropout(0.1)(title_features)
title_features = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(title_features)
```


```python
output = layers.Dense(2, name = "fake")(title_features)
```


```python
model = keras.Model(
      inputs = title_input,
      outputs = output
        )
```


```python
#compile the model
model.compile(optimizer = "adam",
loss = losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

Now we train the model using 40 epochs.


```python
history = model.fit(train, validation_data=val, epochs = 40)
```

    Epoch 1/40

To visualize the training history, I define a function called **visualize_history**:


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def visualize_history(history, min_acc):
  """
  This function helps to visualize training history or our model.
  """
  acc = history.history['accuracy']
  val_acc = history.history['val_accuracy']

  plt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))
  plt.plot(acc, label='Training Accuracy')
  plt.plot(val_acc, label='Validation Accuracy')
  plt.axhline(y= min_acc, color='green', label='Minimum accuracy = {m}%'.format(m=round(min_acc*100, 1)))
  plt.legend(loc='lower right')
  plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
  plt.ylim([min(plt.ylim()),1])
  plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')
```


```python
visualize_history(history, 0.97)
```


    
![png](output_33_0.png)
    


The model achieves around 99% accuracy, which is very impressive! Also there is no sign of overfitting because the validation accuracy is consistently high.

## Second Model

For the second model, we will only be using the article **text**. I have also tried several different parameters for the Dropout layer. A dropout rate of 15% is ideal from my observation, because higher dropout resulted in a perceivably higher accuracy for the validation set than the training set, which is somewhat unnecessary. 

I also tried ou 20/30/40 epochs. Over several trials, the model performance became stable for more than 30 epochs.


```python
text_features = vectorize_layer(text_input)
text_features = embedding(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dropout(0.15)(text_features)
text_features = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dropout(0.15)(text_features)
text_features = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(text_features)
```


```python
output2 = layers.Dense(2, name = "fake")(text_features)
```


```python
model2 = keras.Model(
      inputs = text_input,
      outputs = output2
        )
```


```python
model2.compile(optimizer = "adam",
loss = losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy']
)
```


```python
history2 = model2.fit(train, validation_data=val, epochs = 40)
```

Our second model achieves around 98% accuracy, which is also very impressive, but not so good as the first model. It might because given that the models are similarly complicated, the text contains much more information than the title (and more noise). Similarly, there is no sign of overfitting.

## Third Model

For our last model, we use **both the title and text** to train our model. For this model I further modified the dropout layers a bit, so I didn't use the features I created before. In particular, I used only one dropout layer for each feature because we don't need to drop out too much information.

Since there are more information involved, I decided to train the model using 50 epochs.


```python
title_features2 = vectorize_layer(title_input)
title_features2 = embedding_large(title_features2) 
title_features2 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(title_features2)
#only one drop out layer for the title input
title_features2 = layers.Dropout(0.1)(title_features2)
title_features2 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(title_features2)
```


```python
text_features2 = vectorize_layer(text_input)
text_features2 = embedding_large(text_features2)
text_features2 = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(text_features2)
#only one drop out layer for the title input
text_features2 = layers.Dropout(0.1)(text_features2)
text_features2 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(text_features2)
```


```python
main = layers.concatenate([title_features2,text_features2],axis = 1)
```


```python
main = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(main)
output3 = layers.Dense(2, name = "fake")(main)
```


```python
model3 = keras.Model(
    inputs = [title_input, text_input],
    outputs = output3
)
```


```python
model3.compile(optimizer = "adam",
loss = losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy']
)
```


```python
history3 = model3.fit(train, validation_data=val, epochs = 50)
```

Wow! We actually achieved above 99% accuracy after around 30 epochs, and almost a hundred percent accuracy at the end. Comparing to the models that use a single input, the third model with mixed features seem to be the best to use. 

To answer the question we posted in the beginning, I would say: the algorithms should probably use **both the title and the text** when seeking to detect fake news.

## §4. Model Evaluation

Now we’ll test the model performance on unseen test data. We focus on the best model which is the third one. We also use the function **make_dataset** that we previously defined to create the tf dataset.



```python
test_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_test.csv?raw=true"
```


```python
test = pd.read_csv(test_url)
```


```python
#use the function to create tf dataset
test = make_dataset(test)
```


```python
model3.evaluate(test)
```

    225/225 [==============================] - 3s 11ms/step - loss: 0.0707 - accuracy: 0.9860





    [0.07072754204273224, 0.9860127568244934]



We got 98.6% accuracy on our testing data! Great job.

## §5. Embedding Visualization

For the last part of our blog post, let's try to visualize the embedding result of our model and see if we can somehow interpret it. When I'm implementing this part, I actually went back and change the embedding dimension to be 10 (as professor suggested), hoping that our embedding can better separate the two classes (fake and true news) later on.


```python
embedding_large = layers.Embedding(3000, 10, name = "embedding_large") 
#I trained my third model on this embedding_large layer. After that I ran the codes below:
```


```python
weights = model3.get_layer('embedding_large').get_weights()[0]
vocab = vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()
```

Each element of *weights* should contain ten numbers.


```python
weights
```

We transform the 10-dimensional data back to 2-dimensional for plotting purposes using PCA:


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA 
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
weights = pca.fit_transform(weights)
```


```python
weights #now two dimensional
```

Thanks to the 10-dimensional embedding, we can see that the graph is stretched out in the diagonal direction. Specifically, several words caught my attention: 

**"literally," "extremely"** and **"felt"** can be found in the upper right corner. These three words don't show up frequently in authentic news, and they tend to be subjective and emotional. The model is able to make use of this information in classifying the news.

In comparison, I noticed that words on the bottom left corner are more neutral in attitude and more descriptive (ie. **"considering, "revealed"**), and a lot of them are related to politics (**"mayor," "minister"**). The model is able to smartly utilize these information as well.

This is the end of our blog post 6!
