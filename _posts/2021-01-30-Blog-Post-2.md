title: Blog Post 2 Webpage Development

Hello! In today's post, we will want to build an interesting interative website together. This exercise can be pretty challenging (at least for me) but it is really very engaging as well.<br>
In general, we would want to build a simple message bank that can do two things:<br>

**1.Allow the user to submit messages to the bank.**<br>
**2.Allow the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.**   
<br> Before we start, here's a link to my repository: https://github.com/jqlaura/Blog_Post_2_Files

## PART I. Coding

Since this is more of a Python related "tutorial", we would assume that most templates are already there for you to use. To briefly explain, we would need our main file "app.py" that contains all the necessary functions, a folder containing all the templates (ie. base.html, submit.html and so on), and a folder with our css file for personalize styling.

To look specifically into a template, let's take a look at the *"submit.html"* template that I think is the most interesting. The code is shown below:

```html {%raw%}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block header %}
  <h1>{% block title %}Submit{% endblock %}</h1>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <form method="post">
      <label for="message">Your message:</label>
      <br>
      <input type = "text" name="message" id="message">
      <br>
      <label for="handle">Your name or handle:</label>
      <br>
      <input type = "text" name="handle" id="handle">
      <br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit message">

  {% if thank %}
    <br>
    Thanks for submitting your message!
  {% endif %}

{% endblock %} 
{%endraw%}
```


We can see roughly from the template above that it helps to construct a webpage that prompts the user to enter certain inputs. For instance, after showing the message "Your message:", we follow by a place for the user to enter their message and we sotre it as a "text" input named "message". This should be pretty intuitive.<br>
Also, notice that "thank" is a variable we created that will generate some thank you text when the user submit a message.

Now I want to explain all the different functions I use in building this webpage.

We start from importing all the necessary packages and modules:


```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request

import sklearn as sk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pickle
import sqlite3

from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure

import io
import base64
```

Then we initializes our SQL database using Flask:


```python
def init_auth_db():
    db = get_auth_db()

    with current_app.open_resource('init.sql') as f:
        db.executescript(f.read().decode('utf8'))

# Create web app, run with flask run

app = Flask(__name__)
```

After that we basically define the routes for each of our functions, followed by the function definitions. Below is the function for the main page structure that doesn't need much explanation:


```python
@app.route('/')
def main():
    return render_template('main.html')
```

Now we write the "submit" function, which uses two methods =['POST', 'GET'], and for each we define a specific action. 


```python
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        get_message_db()
        insert_message(request)
        return render_template('submit.html', thank = True)
```

After that we have the "view" function, which will return a collection of n random messages from the message_db, or fewer if necessary. Here I pick n to be 5.


```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():
   messages = random_messages(5)
   return render_template('view.html', AllMessages = messages)
```

Now, we define more "functional" functions, because they perform more important tasks. The get_message_db() function below, for example, creates the database (and the table) for storing the messages if it does not exist.


```python
def get_message_db():
    #create the database if it does not exist
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('message_db.sqlite')
    #execute command
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    cmd = '''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages 
            (id INT, handle TEXT, message TEXT)'''
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    return g.message_db
```

The next important function is insert_message(request), which extract both the *message* and the *handle* from the input and insert it into the table in our database. Detailed explanations are provided in the comments:


```python
def insert_message(request):
    #store values into temporary variables
    message = request.form["message"]
    handle = request.form["handle"]
    #create cursor and execute insertion commands
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    cursor.execute("select count(*) from messages")
    #create a unique id acccording to the length of the current table
    id = 1 + cursor.fetchone()[0]
    cmd = '''INSERT INTO messages VALUES 
    ({id},'{handle}','{message}')
    '''.format(id=id, handle=handle, message=message)
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    #commit the changes and close the connection
    g.message_db.commit()
    g.message_db.close()
```

Here comes, finally, our last function needed. This function is called random_messages() and it helps generate n (=5 in my example) random messages in the current database. If there are less than 5 messages, just display all of them.


```python
def random_messages(n):
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    #create cursor and execute the command that gets the length of the table
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    cursor.execute("select count(*) from messages")
    rows = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    if rows > n:
        rows = n
    #select the random messages
    cmd = '''
    SELECT message,handle FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT {rows};
    '''.format(rows=rows)
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    messages = cursor.fetchall()
    g.message_db.close()
    return messages
```

Now that we finished writing all the functions, and after I added a personalize CSS style to my webpage (that is very pinky), let's see how our webpage works!

## PART II. Demonstration

Visiting our website and click on the link "Submit a message", we will see the page below:

![message.png](/images/message.png)

Now let's enter some input into the two boxes to see what will happen. I put "Let's get A+ for the class!" as my message (an uplifting one, right?) and "Lauraa" with an extra a as my name. Clicking the submit button, we will see the thank you message:

![submit.png](/images/submit.png)

After we submit our message, let's go to the page where we can view random messages. Note that everytime we refresh the page, it will show different messages! (I'm sorry for entering so many random messages during testing though.) In most messages, you can see my nickname "Laura".

And this is the end of my blog post 2!
